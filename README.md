# One Percent Better

## Motivation

Growth Mindset is a skill that I actively practice every day. I wanted to create an application that would combine the ideas of Growth Mindset with the idea of 1% improvements in James Clear's book "Atomic Habits."

In One Percent Better, you can create areas, which are topics or skills you are actively trying to get better at. Each day, you can log what you practiced. When you click 'Add Improvement', a data point gets added showing your skills in that area increasing by 1%.
